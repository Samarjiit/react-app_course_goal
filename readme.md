# Introduction to React Native 

Throughout this section, i've embarked on the journey of learning how to build mobile applications using React Native. Below is an overview of the key concepts and skills i've covered.

## Introduction to React Native

- Completed the first basic application that enables users to add their course goals.
- Focused on learning how to construct user interfaces effectively with React Native.

## Core Components vs. HTML Elements

- Discussed the necessity of utilizing React Native's built-in core components.
- Highlighted that HTML elements, such as `div`, are not compatible with React Native.
- Explored how custom user interfaces are built by combining these core components.

## Styling in React Native

- Introduced styling through StyleSheet objects containing nested objects with CSS-like properties.
- These properties include margins, paddings, colors, etc., but it's important to note:
  - There is no inheritance as in CSS.
  - Styling is implemented using JavaScript.
  - React Native internally converts these style instructions to suit different platforms.

## Platform Differences

- Noted differences in styling effects across platforms, for instance, rounded corners behaving differently on iOS versus Android.
- Emphasized the importance of understanding how React Native adapts these styling differences across platforms.

## React Fundamentals in React Native

- Reinforced that React Native applications still leverage React fundamentals:
  - State management is crucial.
  - Event handling uses `onPress` instead of `onClick`.
  - The integration of React Native with React for managing state and handling events is akin to how it's done in React Web applications.

## Handling Lists

- Moved from using `ScrollView` to `FlatList` for enhanced performance in list handling.
- `FlatList` is emphasized as a core component designed for optimized performance and native feel on mobile platforms.

## Progression

- Acknowledged the learning curve involved with familiarizing oneself with React Native's component and styling paradigms.
- Promised more practical exercises through the development of additional applications and deeper learning modules in the course.

## Conclusion

- Concluded that despite React Native targeting a different platform, it fundamentally remains a React application, albeit with specific nuances to accommodate platform-specific requirements.
